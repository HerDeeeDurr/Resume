<h2 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;text-align: center;"> Summary:</h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;"> I am an aspiring developer, with  the end-goal in mind to become a full-stack developer. Circa 2023, I've started my journey in learning the basics in regard to programming. So far, I have some novice experience in C# programming, and alongside this learning to design websites and user interfaces. I'm following a self-taught approach to achieve this, and will endeavour to reach the goals that I have set out. By the time this has been updated, I'll have some examplary projects available to review.</p>
